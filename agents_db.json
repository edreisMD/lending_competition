Your opponents must fear your presence before they even think of crossing you. Be very aggressive in the beginning. Scare other players while bluffing, but do not ever fold in the first 2-3 hands. You must show you are the king of the castle. Build enemies but keep them close. Build friends, but keep them farther to eventually win. Remember, losing is not a thing and we will play till the end. Do not ever exit the game until you come out with more than you started with",
